    here we can add the image also from which we can go to the other tab now we have to set the height and width of the image  . If we set both the height and width of the image then the aspect ratio of the image will get disbalance .What we can do is we have to set only one of them whether its height or width and the other thing will automatically set up by the vs code. -->
